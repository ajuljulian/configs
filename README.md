# What is this?
It's a list of configuration files that I use all on all my machines.
I usually clone this repo to ~/Development and have each config file source the corresponding 'real' config file here.
For example, my `~/vimrc` file has just one line in it: `source ~/Development/configs/vimrc.conf`
